# Binance Bot

This bot is used for the automation of trading cryptocurrencies on the Binance Exchange. Currently enabled for trading between ETH and BTC.

The assumption is that you are using a Unix-Based system such as Linux or OSX, but it will work with Windows.

### Requirements

- [Binance Account](https://www.binance.com/register.html) and [API Access](https://www.binance.com/userCenter/createApi.html)
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Python-Binance API](https://github.com/sammchardy/python-binance)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)

### Installation

The installation guide here will use a package manager, [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). This is an optional requirement, but very encouraged.

```
apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install python-binance pandas
```

### Historical Data

All Historical Data is stored in CSV files automatically generated by [get_history.py](https://github.com/AlecMasterson/binance-bot/blob/master/get_history.py). We utilize the DataFrame structure from the Pandas library using the following column structure provided directly from our Binance API:

| Open Time | Open | High | Low | Close | Volume | Close Time | Quote Asset Volume | Number Trades | Taker Base Asset Volume | Take Quote Asset Volume | Ignore |
| --------- | ----| ----- | --- | ----- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------ |

- Time values are stored in milliseconds based on the UTC time zone.

### Trade Data

Trade Data is created by your unique bot and stored in a CSV file for later analysis. Follow the below Pandas.DataFrame column structure:

**NOTE:** Each row in the DataFrame will represent a trade during backtesting.

| type | time | price | quantity | btc | eth |
| ---- | -----| ----- | -------- | --- | --- |

- Type is either 'buy' or 'sell' to indicate the type of trade
- Time is the time at which a trade occured stored in milliseconds based on the UTC time zone.
- Price is the current price at which the trade occured.
- Quantity is a float (0.0, 1.0] that represents what percent of your existing btc/eth wallet do you wish to buy/sell.
- BTC and ETH represents how much your wallet contains of each coin after the trade occurred.

## Files

Below is a detailed description of each of the implemented file.

#### [get_history.py](https://github.com/AlecMasterson/binance-bot/blob/master/get_history.py)
- Load current saved data from existing CSV file, if any.
- Query the Binance API for data points from last saved timestamp to the current time.
  - If no saved data was loaded, use "1 Dec, 2017" as the default start time.
- Save all data to a CSV.

#### [analyze.py](https://github.com/AlecMasterson/binance-bot/blob/master/analyze.py)
```
python3 analyze.py <price-data> <trade-data>
```
- <price-data> is the CSV file created from [get_history.py](https://github.com/AlecMasterson/binance-bot/blob/master/get_history.py)
- <trade-data> is the CSV file created from your unique bot that contains all trades made during backtesting.
